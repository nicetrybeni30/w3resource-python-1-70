# compute the value of N 3 times for solution is n + nn + nnn

# Prompt the user to input an integer
a = str(5)
#why make this a string its because its consistent and unchangeable

# Calculate the sum of the integer and its concatenated forms
result = int(a) + int(a * 2) + int(a * 3)

# Print the result
print(result)
