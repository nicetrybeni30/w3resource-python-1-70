# 1. Use 'socket.gethostname()' to get the local hostname.
# 2. Use 'socket.gethostbyname_ex()' to get a list of IP addresses associated with the hostname.
# 3. Filter the list to exclude any IP addresses starting with "127." (loopback addresses).
# 4. Extract the first IP address (if available) from the filtered list.
# 5. Print the obtained IP address to the console.
